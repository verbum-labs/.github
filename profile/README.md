# Verbum Labs

Verbum Labs is a Catholic charity that is deeply involved in technology. Our mission is to help people love God more and more, and we do this through different types of projects. To ensure our financial self-sufficiency, we also place ourselves as a player in the market, in this way we use the profits from our products to finance our mission of evangelization.
